							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">With the advance in network and communications technologies, video data takes more than 70% of internet traffic, video contents take an important position in multimedia services. Due to the continuous advance in network, display and broadcasting services, new video services of ultra high quality will get prevailed and the video contents of ultra high quality will prevail dramatically in telecommunications and broadcasting networks. So, we live with our daily life in an new era that the video contents of ultra high quality can be freely consumed anytime and anywhere over various multimedia devices. Therefore, it has been consistently demanded that high efficiency video compression be necessarily to be developed.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">Due to the rapid grow of UHD video services, the video content services such as UHDTV/broadcasting, and video streaming need to require more advanced video compression technologies that allow to reduce the storage and transmission overheads. The previous video coding technologies have limitation in coding efficiency due to the limited usage of image block coding units, called macroblocks(MBs). Since the spatial resolution of video has been increased and UHD resolutions are expected to be popular for video contents in future. It has been therefore a requirement on coding efficiency for UHD video contents. In order to meet this requirement, we designed a new coding unit structure which extends the previous MB structure by enlarging the MB size and allowing flexible partitions into smaller sub-coding units.</p>
							<p class="mt30"; style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">So the new coding unit structure makes it possible more adaptive for video of various signal characteristics to enhance the coding efficiency. The residual signals within the flexible partitioned sub coding unit blocks can efficiently be encoded with variable block-sized transforms by mixture of intra and inter coding tools in each coding unit.</p>

							<p class="mt30"; style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">Since video data has a nature of large data sizes, it is often necessary to compress them for efficient storage and transmission. Moreover, for the interoperability among digital devices, MPEG-2 Video and H.264/AVC(Advanced Video Coding) standards have often been used for digital TV/broadcasting and DMB/IPTV services. Until the H.264/AVC standard, video data has been encoded in 16?16 pixel units for every input frame, which limits the coding efficiency. In this research, a flexible extended coding block structure has been designed to enhance the coding efficiency, which makes it easier the adaptation to various image signal characteristics. The previous video coding standards only allow each macroblock(MB) to be either intra-frame coded or inter-frame coded. In our coding block structure, each coding unit block which is larger than the MB size can flexibly partitioned into many sub-blocks, each of which can be coded in either intra or inter coding modes. That is, each coding unit block is allowed to have both inter-coded and intra-coded sub-blocks, and to use variable block-sized transforms, which can significantly improve the overall coding efficiency. This coding unit block structure of High Efficiency Video Coding, which has been jointly standardized by ITU-T and ISO/IEC, has almost the similar block structure as our design. HEVC is expected to be popularly used for UHD TV and ultra high quality video coding. Our method and design for flexible coding unit structure and coding methods has been registered as patents which have been evaluated as essential patents of HEVC. So, KAIST became, as an essential HEVC patent holder, an Original Licensor of the HEVC patents program managed by MPEGLA. Therefore, KAIST has an opportunity of benefiting from significant amounts of licensing fees for HEVC standard patents.</p>
							<p class="mt30"; style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">Adopted as the video coding tool for UHD(Ultra High Definition)TV/broadcasting, Cable TV. Adopted in high-end smart phones(Apple iPhone6/iPhone6+, Samsung Galaxy S6/S6 Edge, LG G4, etc.), digital cameras/camcoders, video recording/security cameras, DVD Players, video streaming services. Due to fast and wide adoption of HEVC, related markers are expected to grow fast, which makes KAIST benefit from a large amount of licensing fees.</p>
