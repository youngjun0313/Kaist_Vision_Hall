							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">A research team led by Professor Jeong Ho Lee proved the origin of the mutation that drives various brain tumors and defined a new molecular pathogenesis of these conditions, thereby providing novel therapeutics.<br>1. Glioblastoma is treated with surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. However, the tumor almost always grows back in less than a year and the median survival time is only 15 months. Precision therapeutic approaches that directly targeted tumors did not lead to any breakthroughs for glioblastoma. The research team led by Professor Jeong Ho Lee identified where the mutation that causes glioblastoma originates. According to the study, neural stem cells away from the tumor mass are the cells of origin that contain mutation drivers for glioblastoma, the most aggressive brain tumor. This breakthrough research, reported in Nature on August 1st, 2018, provides insight for understanding why glioblastoma almost always grows back, even after surgery, and suggests novel methods to treat glioblastoma, which was previously thought to be incurable.<br>2. Pediatric brain tumors are characterized by the frequent complications of intractable epilepsy compared to adult brain tumors. However, the genetic cause of refractory epilepsy in pediatric brain tumors has yet to be elucidated, and it is difficult to treat patients as the tumors do not respond to existing antiepileptic drugs and can debilitate a child’s development. The research team led by Professor Jeong Ho Lee has recently identified that neuronal BRAF somatic mutation causes intrinsic epileptogenicity in pediatric brain tumors. Their research results were published online in Nature Medicine on September 17th, 2018.

							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">Identifying the basic cause of adult malignant brain tumors and presenting new therapies. Glioblastoma is one of the worst prognostic cancers, and we currently have a poor understanding of the underlying cause of tumorigenesis. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, but glioblastoma is incurable by surgery alone as well as concurrent chemo- or radiation therapy. For the first time in the world, it was discovered that a glioblastoma driving mutation originates from the subventricular zone, which is far from the cancer, instead of the cancerous site itself. (Published in 2018 Nature) Identifying the root cause of pediatric brain tumors accompanied by intractable epilepsy and presenting a new treatment method. Pediatric brain tumors are characterized by frequent complications of intractable epilepsy compared to adult brain tumors. The specific cause of intractable epilepsy in pediatric brain tumors has not been elucidated and the tumors do not respond to existing anticonvulsant drugs, rendering treatment difficult. This study demonstrates the underlying causes and the developmental principles of such pediatric brain tumors, and presents a new therapeutic method. (Published in 2018 Nature Medicine).</p>
