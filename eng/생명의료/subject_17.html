							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">In life science and medical research, the ability to measure three-dimensional images of cells is essential. However, since existing techniques use fluorescent proteins or staining procedures, it is difficult to observe live cells, especially immune cells or stem cells, which can be re-injected into the body. We apply the principle of CT imaging at the microscopic level using a laser based on digital holography technology. This makes it possible to measure 3D images of cells and observe the inside of cells without having to rely on staining.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">The team started the company with the support of KAIST’s End Run Project and successfully achieved commercialization in early 2016, after which it released the product. So far, the company has built an international sales network comprised of more than 10 countries and started exporting overseas. Currently, several leading institutes are using the company’s product , including MIT, Pittsburgh Medical School, the German Cancer Center, and Seoul National University Asan Hospital. The product is based on a technology that implements the principle of X-ray CT using a laser. In X-ray CT, the internal organs of a patient are visualized using X-ray absorptiometry; our technique, however, makes use of the RI values of cells or organelles. This technology allows the 3D imaging of living cells in a very short time. Previously, fluorescence proteins were used to stain cells to obtain 3D images, but this staining process makes it difficult to measure live cells. In particular, it was impossible to apply to immune cells or stem cells that are injected into the body. Quantitative data, such as density, mass, and volume, can be obtained from the RI information, which is widely used in various fields, such as nanoscience, cell biology, microbiology, and disease diagnosis.</p>
