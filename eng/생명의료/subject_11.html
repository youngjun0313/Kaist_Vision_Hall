							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">LIN28, which is a major factor in induced pluripotent stem cells, plays important roles in self-renewal of stems cells, pluripotency and controlling differentiation and development. It also controls the expression of c-Myc gene, which is decisive in controlling the cell growth, and regulates cancer cells. By controlling the maturation of let-7 miRNA, which is a major LIN28 miRNA, the protein was thought to control cell growth, but this was not proved with epigenetic molecular regulatory mechanisms. Therefore this study has significance in elucidating the epigenetic molecular mechanism of let-7 miRNA maturation regulation by LIN28 in human embryonic stem cells and in wide application including not only embryonic stem cells but also in iPSC and cancer therapy on clinical level.</p>
							<p class="mt30"; style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">LIN28-mediated processing of the microRNA(miRNA) let-7 has emerged as a multilevel program that controls self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. LIN28A is believed to act primarily in the cytoplasm together with TUT4/7 to prevent final maturation of let- 7 by Dicer, whereas LIN28B has been suggested to preferentially act on nuclear processing of let-7. Here, we find that SET7/9 monomethylation in a putative nucleolar localization region of LIN28A increases its nuclear retention and protein stability. In the nucleoli of human embryonic stem cells, methylated LIN28A sequesters pri-let-7 and blocks its processing independently of TUT4/7. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the posttranslational methylation of nuclear LIN28A and its ability to modulate pluripotency by repressing let-7 miRNA expression in human embryonic stem cells.</p>

								<span class="img_sbj">Fig 2. It is expected to provide much insight into understanding the characteristics of stem cells in terms of pluripotency regulation  of<br>embryonic stem cells by LIN28A. LIN28A is involved not only in embryonic stem cells but also deeply in iPSC and therefore has high probability of application. Novel methodology can be proposed for increasing the <br>efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cells upon the results of the study<br>and there is probability as the new target for anticancer substance.</span>
