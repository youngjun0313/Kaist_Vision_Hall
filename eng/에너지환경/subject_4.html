							<p style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">In the near future, micro modular nuclear reactors will be developed and will supply electrical needs in various regions. Micro modular reactors have better safety and are easier in maintenance compared to conventional large reactors, which leads to lower probability of severe accidents. Even in case of an accident, the total amount of radioactive material is small. Therefore, damage to the environment can be minimized. After permanent shutdown, the reactor module can be taken back to the factory and decommissioned leaving minimum amount of radioactivity in the reactor site. Conventional reactors use the water cycle, but the newly proposed micro modular reactor of KAIST has adopted the CO2 loop for cooling and power generation. This allows long life spans up to 20 years without refueling. Also the power generation system can be reduced in size so that the whole module can be transported by a truck.</p>

							<p class="mt30"; style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">With these various advantages, the KAIST micro modular reactor can be applied for electricity generation on offshore plants, polar regions, Alaska, Russia, Northern Europe, Middle East, Africa, and many other regions under extreme weather conditions. Also the micro modular reactor uses CO2 as its coolant and does not require cooling water, so it can be used for an independent power source in small cities with populations of few hundreds of thousands even in inland. It can also be applied in space travels or in exploration bases on the moon where water and air are valuable.</p> 
							<p class="mt30"; style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">Throughout the world, interest is moving towards small modular reactor systems. However, if we observe the currently proposed designs, most have succeeded in decreasing the size, but haven't been able to completely modularize the whole reactor. To break the limits, the supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle was chosen over the steam Rankine cycle for the power generation cycle. Also, the proposed reactor is a gas cooled reactor which can run without refueling for 20 years. The power generation cycle is integrated with the reactor to further modularize it. To guarantee its safety over long operational time, new designs that haven't been used in conventional large reactors were adopted in the power generation system. The development of the proposed reactor will allow nuclear power to contribute not only in power generation but also in energy dependent industries like offshore plants, heavy chemical industry, steel industry, and etc. which would ultimately reduce green house gas emission. Furthermore, energy supply for extreme environments(polar areas, deserts, space, and etc) will be available for long periods of time. The existing small modular reactor designs mostly use water as the coolant and oxidized uranium as fuel. Although these may be good choices in making large reactors economical, there are economical limits when the capacity is reduced.</p>
							<p class="mt30"; style="text-align: justify; word-break: keep-all">This research aims to overcome these issues by adopting a supercritical CO2 cooled micro modular reactor(KAIST MMR) concept that uses a long period core(can be run for more than 20 years without refueling) with supercritical CO2 as coolant and uranium-nitride as fuel was developed. Also, by actively adopting the supercritical CO2 power system, designated as one of top thirteen industry engine project, we have simplified the power conversion system and developed a new nuclear power system that can passively remove the decay heat in case of reactor shutdown to avoid another Fukushima accident. As our main research achievement, the feasibility of downsizing and modularization of nuclear power plant was confirmed by designing the reactor core and power generation system in one vessel. Also, in reactor design, uranium-nitride, suitable for long period low enriched uranium fast reactors, was selected; the dynamic properties and variables for nuclear reactor control were designed and evaluated. In the power generation system, the small sizing and high efficiency advantage of supercritical CO2 power conversion system was actively utilized to create a very simple and high efficiency system. Moreover, PCHE, a next generation heat exchanger that adopts semiconductor manufacturing process, was used and a technical accomplishment of using radial turbomachinery, which are not used for large reactors, was achieved. As seen in the Fukushima accident, nuclear reactors produce large amounts of decay heat even after shutdown and if external power source is not provided, catastrophes can happen. To avoid such events, The proposed KAIST MMR(Micro Modular Reactor) consists of a passive heat removal system that can cool the reactor with natural circulation in case of reactor shutdown.</p>

								<span class="img_sbj">Fig 1. A safe and economical nuclear power plant concept that can be applied for distributed generation was proposed. Small cities, developing countries with difficulties adopting large reactors, middle easter n countries with water shortages, and polar areas are the potential demands of the safe and reliable small modular reactor. Energy dependent industries such as ocean industry, chemical industry, steel industry, and etc can adopt technology to reduce carbon dioxide reduction. Economical nuclear power plants can be supplied to the society through modularization which results in shortened construction time. Working with the supercritical CO2 power generation system development project included in the top thirteen industrial engine hosted by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, a nuclear reactor concept that can play a leading role in nuclear energy application of next generation power generation system was proposed.</span>
